# inference-gateway — llm-d scale-tier substrate

The minimal cluster substrate the **llm-d scale tier** (`LLMDEndpoint`) needs:

- **`gie-crds.yaml`** — Gateway API Inference Extension CRDs (v1.5.0), notably
  `InferencePool`. The llm-d router chart creates an `InferencePool` per model.
- **`repo-secret.yaml`** — registers the `ghcr.io/llm-d/charts` OCI Helm registry
  with ArgoCD, so the `Application` rendered by the `LLMDEndpoint` RGD can pull
  the `llm-d-router-standalone` chart.

## Why this is all that's here

The productized scale tier runs the llm-d router in **standalone mode** (the
router carries its own Envoy proxy + EPP per `InferencePool`). Per the llm-d
guide, standalone mode requires **only the GIE CRDs** — no shared Envoy Gateway.
Ingress is **ALB → LiteLLM** (see `docs/llm-d-and-ingress-architecture.md`), so
there is no Envoy front door either. The earlier Envoy Gateway / Envoy AI Gateway
/ Gateway-CR stack was therefore unused and has been removed.

## How it's delivered

A default ArgoCD platform component, delivered by the `platform` ApplicationSet
(`argocd/bootstrap/platform.yaml`, the `inference-gateway` element, infra tier) —
exactly like `gpu-operator` / `kuberay`. It ships on every cluster: the footprint
is minimal (CRDs + a repo Secret, no running pods), and shipping it by default
means teams can use `LLMDEndpoint` without a separate cluster toggle. Terraform is
not involved.
