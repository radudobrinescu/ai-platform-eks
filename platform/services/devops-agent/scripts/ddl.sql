-- DevOps Agent state schema.
-- Applied by db-init Job (PreSync hook) on first deploy.
-- Idempotent — uses CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS.

-- The investigations table is the single source of truth for the
-- agent's lifecycle: every event becomes a row, every status change
-- updates that row, the remediation result is appended in-place.
-- Replay/audit queries: SELECT * FROM investigations ORDER BY created_at DESC;
